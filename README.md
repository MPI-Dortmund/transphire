Install transphire

> pip install transphire


### Installation inside your own environment that matches the requirements

## Run TranSPHIRE

Make sure, that you have your transphire environment active.
If you start TranSPHIRE for the first time:

> transphire --edit\_settings

In case the appearing window is too large for your screen, adjust the font size (default 20).  
For example:

> transphire --edit\_settings --font 8

First got to the **TranSPHIRE settings** tab and after that the **Font** tab.
Adjust the *Font* value.
If necessary, the other options can be adjusted at a later point, after the GUI is opened.

Open the other tabs and adjust the settings according to your system.

Close the dialog and the GUI will open.

In the future, you only need to run:

> transphire

If you want to run TranSPHIRE, fill in the tabs from left to right (General to CTF) and press the Start button.

A more detailed tutorial will be available soon.
